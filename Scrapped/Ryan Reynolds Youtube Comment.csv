18;Trap Himawari;Ads and commercials can be amazing sometimes, it adds to the media experience especially when done right, and plenty of actors started their career as commercial/ad actors and its good to give this form of commercial acting a chance to prove itself that its more than just corporates trying to sell you stuff because ads and commercials also contribute to culture of which products we consume or associate with, and usually high profile actors such as yourself get a bad wrap from doing these ads but tbh they simply don't understand that acting is more than just a job but a lifestyle, and its not just with ads especially with actors auditioning and casting for b-rated movies think that its just a cash grab well sometimes it is but it adds experience and gets actors more aquatinted to the acting lifestyle no matter how big or small a role is, every seemingly mediocre aspect is always important for acting and I thank you Ryan and every actor out there who is working their hardest in whatever role they portray no matter how big or small or its purpose its always at the end of the day for self improvement and I hope one day everyone especially with those who are not knowledgeable in acting will understand one day and learn to love the little things in general;28;1 REPLY;3 weeks ago

44;paladonis;"Wish we had more of this stuff when I was younger. I grew up doing stage acting, mostly at school, from the 4th grade through a single college performance before dropping out of Community College. I LOVED it. I was always young enough looking to play younger roles. Imagine getting to play a 15 yr old boy, playing a female part, in a story about Shakespeare's life (A cry of Players) when you are 18. Lots of fun. I did a ton of technical theater too. Lights, sound, was a stage manager on several occasions. But, grew to tell myself I didn't fit the ""body type"" and moved away from it. Got a little of it back when I gave education talks at an Aquarium I worked at for 13 years, but well ya...sorry for the monologue.

53;Alto Burger;I love your enthusiasm for the industry... It's just a shame that so many of the people in all those other jobs you describe take heavy amounts of drugs and alcohol just to get through the day while the actor/s usually roll up late forcing everyone into overtime on nearly every single shift. I had to leave production and go into broadcast. Less overtime, more time with the family and everyone you work with (apart from the standard hierarchy in any industry) is on a level playing field. 200 people aren't forced to lose sleep and have anxiety and stress piled on top of more anxiety and stress because 1 person decided to turn up late.;1;0 REPLY;3 weeks ago

343;kyrotenkaithescarred;Ryan, in my opinion if you are actually serious about this then your website needs some work.  There is barely any information about what you will be getting access to once you sign up. To be honest it looks like a scam on the surface. The website of an organization is its face and you should be well aware of how important that can be.;0;0 REPLY;9 days ago

789;Perry;There is only one God who exists as three distinct persons who are coequal and coeternal, God the Father, God the Son, and God The Holy Spirit. God loves us and wants a relationship with us. The bad news is that sin separates us from God. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, sins such as lying, stealing, anger, lust, pride, fornication, abortion, dishonoring our parents, and gossip. God is Holy and Just and because of this, God cannot let sin go unpunished, and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We need something more than our own righteousness.;0;0 REPLY;3 weeks ago
