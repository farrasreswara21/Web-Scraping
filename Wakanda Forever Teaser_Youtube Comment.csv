657,Mukonazwothe Bvumbi,"Personally, I think Nakia is going to be the new black panther, simply because of how the trailer started other than the fact that she overall deserves to be the next black panther. The opening scene in my view‚Äôs foreshadowing how Nakia is going to have a bigger role in this sequel. She‚Äôs a warrior, knows hand to hand combat and secrets of wakanda given how she had a relationship with T‚Äôchalla. I think Shuri is going to be left as the funny, open hearted character we know her to be with a few badass scenes. Making her the black panther now would seem rushed regardless of whether or not she was the next black panther in the comics. Nakia is the perfect candidate to be the next black panther",8,1 reply,12 hours ago

If Robert Downey, Jr. had passed away after the first Iron Man movie Disney would never have killed off the character Tony Stark/Iron Man and replaced him with a new character for the rest their Avenger storyline.  If that's not apparent to you, remember that Edward Norton was their first Bruce Banner.  They kept the characters intact because they believe that they are important.  The fact that they saw T'challa as disposable, shows exactly how differently Disney values this character and the significance behind it.  Furthermore, using the loss of Chadwick Boseman to give their film an emotional duality Disney twice dishonors him.  They knew this would have a better chance at drawing people to the box office.  Just remember Disney chose to dismantle everything meaningful about the Black Panther to tug at those heart strings of yours.",0,0 reply,21 hours ago

1417,Carlos Green,Very emotional trailer hit all the right emotional cues. I will have to boycott this movie for three reasons. No strong black male presence is shown in the trailer. None of the black male characters have an heroic action scene in this trailer. That in itself is a no no. All of the females have a heroic action scene in this trailer. So I have to ask the question what message are you trying to send Disney. The trailer has no balance at all. Since you refuse to recast the character of King T'CHALLA. You're making very clear by the message that you sending that you feel that there's no other exceptional black male actor who can play the same character and continue the legacy of King T'CHALLA. The outright disrespect of using a former living human being death as a way to monetize and profit off of it. I find that very disrespectful and distasteful Disney. I must also boycott this movie. To send a message to Disney. You are not going to disrespect black men by killing off the first and only leading black mcu hero. We have yet to see the character of King T'CHALLA full and complete story with in the MCU.This is why recasting T'CHALLA is important.I love Mr Chadwick bosman as an actor who played the character very well. But he is dead and the character story must be able to move forward. Since they are hell bent on pushing this narrative forward of no recasting . Boycotting is the only way. # recast King T'CHALLA with another exceptional black male actor.,0,0 reply,10 hours ago

Loved the beauty of fictional but very much inspired by real African culture, theme, costumes and everything. Chadwick really embodied the humble but strong, emotional but fearless King of Wakanda. It was so tragic to lose him because he was such an inspirational and amazing human being. The fact that Black Panther (1) was such a blockbuster hit and iconic film and to not have T'Challa in it really hurts. IMO, I hope Eric Kilmonger carries the torch because he also has a lot of pain in his heart that caused him to do bad things but he can right his wrongs as the King of Wakanda and Black Panther.",0,0 reply,1 day ago

2746,ImADragonMyGuy,"I think Marvel may have done one of the most smartest and clever thing in a trailer when Angela Basset is giving that speech and when M'Baku and Nakia are looking up in confusion, the Dora Milaje SURRENDERING (which remember, ""The Dora Milaje have jurisdiction whereever the Dora Milaje find themselves to be""), which the first 2 could be seeing the flood of Wakanda in their own perspectives (but idk if M'Baku cause if the flood was already near him he wouldn't be sitting there, so he's most likely watching those ships) and since it seems like Romonda is probably being bombarded and snaps on whoever's there (Most likely Atlantians) it can really go to show how even the most advanced and powerful nation can be exploited, and all those scenes I mentioned could really tie into the emotion she's feeling during that moment, which when she's giving the speech at the UN (I think thats what it is) is probably after that scene cause she realizes she has to really do something and being the ""Queen of the most powerful nation in the world."" she would want to get people actually to listen.",0,0 reply,5 hours ago
